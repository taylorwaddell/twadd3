User Experience is a foundational concept in any industry where there is a product involved. No matter the medium, if a product exists, and there are users of that product, there is an experience that is important to consider. If there is a groundbreaking product that no one can figure out, or it is frustrating to use, than it is not a groundbreaking product. Therefore, learning techniques to identify and implement an exceptional user experience is essential.

## What is UX?

As with any learning journey, the terms must first be clearly defined.

It is common to find UI and UX used interchangeably. There are a multitude of articles and videos that exist to explain in detail [the differences and similarities between UI and UX](https://www.figma.com/resource-library/difference-between-ui-and-ux?utm_source=twadd.dev). Therefore, little time will be spent here. But the relationship between the two does need to be highlighted.

The user interface, or UI, of a product is the point at which a user interacts with the product. In other words, the tangible aspect of the product. Whereas the user experience is the relationship the user has with the interface.

Food is a great metaphor for these concepts:

| Concept        | Culinary Equivalent                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| User Interface | Presentation, Garnish, Texture, Color |
| User Experince | Taste, Smell, Salivation, Nostalgia   |

Continuing with this metaphor, consider a dish that is presented beautifully, smells pleasant, and is delivered by an excellent server. Yet, in the end, tastes terrible.
Alternatively, consider a dish that is presented poorly and has an odd texture such that no one wants to take a bite. Yet, in actuality, it tastes divine.

UI and UX both play an important role. The presentation, or the interface, invites someone into an experience. Whereas the experience itself is what keeps them coming back.

## Identifying Exceptional UX

Exceptional experiences can be mostly broken up into two theoretical categories. Apparent and Subtle. Apparent user experiences are often what set a product apart in a given category or industry. Subtle user experiences are less obvious, often expected, experiences that typically all the products in a given category or industry will possess.

### Apparent: Apple's Introduction of the Mouse (1983)

This feature opened up an entirely new way to interact with a product. It eliminated an entire educational step for users most users and finally made computers accessible for the average consumer.

> "...what we've done is eliminated a vast body of knowledge that one has to know in order to use this computer."  
> â€” Steve Jobs in a [demonstration with NBC News](https://youtu.be/VKhoCyCJGFk?t=27?utm_source=twadd.dev)

Additional Apparent examples:

- The _Share Password with Contact_ drawer on iPhones.
- Windows + K key to wirelessly connect a Windows computer to an external display.
- Dyson vacuums with laser to show where the dirt is.

### Subtle: Automatic Headlights

In a vast majority of cars manufactured today, the headlights turn on and off automatically in response to the surrounding light conditions. This, at one point, was an apparent feature. These days, this feature is expected and could even lead to frustration, or even a dead battery, if this feature does not exist.

Additional Subtle examples:

- Siri asking if you intend to set a reminder for later this morning when you say "remind me in the morning ..." after midnight.
- Cup holders with handle slots.
- The mouse cursor change to the "hand" (aka `pointer`) when hovering intractable elements on a website.
- Shipping envelopes having a perforated edge for easy opening.

### The Importance of Both

Apparent user experiences are great and are often the beginning of incredible innovations. Subtle experiences combine to bring great satisfaction between the user and the product.

Having both Apparent and Subtle user experiences is what makes a product exceptional.

## The Driving Forces Behind Exceptional UX

There are (at least) three driving forces behind crafting exceptional user experiences. Anticipation, Standardization, and Familiarity.

### Anticipation

Anticipation is having an awareness of what the user will expect to happen and building in accordance to this. For instance, making all the physical buttons on a phone automatically silence the ringer on a phone.  
Situation: Ringer interrupting a moment.  
Desired Outcome: Silence ringer.  
Anticipated User Action: Click physical buttons.

User experiences based on the process of anticipation is often starting point for user experiences that become standard in an industry. Therefore, it is often where the most opportunity lies. Anticipation is simultaneously the most difficult to achieve due to the necessity of audience knowledge. This becomes increasingly more difficult as the user base increases due to the lack of similarity from one user to the next.
This explains the pattern of generic products and specific products in a given category or industry. For example, the average user takes all of there notes in their respective operating system's notes app. Alternatively, a user that is attempting the [Zettelkasten note taking method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1NJYnZCfmY&pp=ygUMemV0dGVsa2FzdGVu?utm_source=twadd.dev) will likely reach for a more specific tool that has _anticipated_ the needs of a note taking system like that. Such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md?utm_source=twadd.dev).

### Standardization

Standardization is consistently using the same artifact or component to achieve a given objective. Transportation infrastructure is a great example of the power of standardization.
There are multiple properties at play within the realm of transportation standards so it is helpful to focus on just one of these properties and work out from there.

For example, colors:

| Color  | Association  |
| ------ | ------------ |
| Red    | Stop         |
| Yellow | Slow/Warning |
| Green  | Go           |
| Blue   | Information  |
| Orange | Construction |
| Brown  | Recreation   |
| White  | Regulatory   |

[Citation](https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/services/publications/fhwaop02084/#:~:text=The%20color%20of,or%20cultural%20interest.)

Because of these standards, much information can be conveyed without much thinking on that part of the user.

The most obvious example is probably the stop sign. The stop sign was designed to be easily recognized from multiple different viewing angles due to it's shape and it transcends language due it's shape and color. Because of the standardization of the shape and color of stop signs, a driver knows exactly what to expect when they pull up to a four-way cross roads with one stop sign facing them and three octagons stationed at the other roads. Though they cannot see the word "STOP" or the color red, they can expect the other drivers to stop.

There are three primary benefits of standardization.  
One being learned anticipation, or in other words, teaching the user to expect a behavior when they encounter a given object or component. This is helpful because then the experience can be shifted and shaped in a way that is new or distinct while maintaining a satisfying experience. This is obviously beneficial in a competitive market.  
The second benefit is reduced friction for the user, which leads to higher efficiency and higher satisfaction with the product.  
The third benefit is that new products can leverage the learned anticipation to create a sense of familiarity, even though the user has no experience with the new product. This same concept can be applied across entirely different industries, leveraging familiarity or recognition of an object or component.

### Recognition

It is no obscurity that humans are creatures of habit. This is a truth that can be leveraged to improve an experience or even make something new, feel familiar. This can be done through the use of objects or components that resemble interfaces that the target audience is already familiar with.  
An easy example of this concept is the trash can icon on nearly every computer. Everyone knows what a trash can is and everyone knows what to do when they have trash in their hand and see a trash can. When software companies needed to create an interface for users to put data that is no longer needed, they chose to leverage recognition to eliminate the need for extra explaining. Brilliant.  
It's worth noting that to successfully use recognition to create an exceptional user experience, the target audience must be well known. A reference to an object or component that is familiar and recognizable to the creator, may have never even been seen by the target audience. This issue is exacerbated when the target audience is global due to completely different, and potentially unfamiliar cultures.

If the target audience is known well, recognition can be incredibly powerful.
If little is known about the target audience, recognition can be dangerous.

## Practical Application

With a strong knowledge of the ingredients that make up exceptional user experiences, one can begin to apply this knowledge to projects. There are a few methods to and practices to consider in order to do this well.

##### 1. Keep an eye out for exceptional User Experiences.

As with any craft, a craftsmen must first learn to recognize the exceptional. No matter the context.

##### 2. Identify friction areas.

A memorable user experience is one that simplifies the complex.

##### 3. Consider all feedback.

Often times, especially within the corporate world, the tendency is to focus on what is wrong. Remember: All feedback is important. Take note of what works well and replicate it.

##### 4. Implement systems to be well acquainted with your audience.

One of the biggest threats to a good product is a slow and steady drift from the audience. Implement systems to stay in touch.

##### 5. Consider audience when making decisions.

## @Developers

It's been said once, but it's worth restating: If there is a groundbreaking product that no one can figure out, or it is frustrating to use, than it is not a groundbreaking product. Do not neglect the importance of the user experience. It's not "going the extra mile" to ensure software is enjoyable to use. It is the minimum and the standard in which all developers should aim.  
Despite common misconceptions, enjoyable software is not difficult to attain and there are a few guiding principles that make it a bit simpler to do well.

##### 1. Consistency. Consistency. Consistency.

Above all be consistent. From a user experience perspective, it's significantly better to use the same button, with the same interaction, in every spot that there is a button needed instead of using a different one every time. A good user experience is a predictable user experience.

##### 2. Learn basic visual design.

Knowing the basics of color, hierarchy, balance, etc will take a developer further than one may imagine. [_Safe Rules_ by Anthony Hobday](https://anthonyhobday.com/sideprojects/saferules?utm_source=twadd.dev) is a great place to start.

##### 3. Use semantic, accessible HTML.

Following the rules of HTML will not only lead to bug-free code, but also a great user experience.

##### 4. Add the label last.

Remember the stop sign. Use everything except words to communicate through the interface what will happen. Then, if the label is still needed, make it valuable.

##### 5. Simplify the DOM

Use as few elements as possible. Repeatedly ask "Is this necessary?" and "What value does this add?"

##### 6. Keep the user informed.

"Is it just loading..? or is it not working?", "Did it save?", "Did it delete?", and "Did it work?" are just a few examples of questions that the user should never have to ask.

##### 7. Ask good questions.

Once again, know the audience. Ask them for feedback and learn from it.

## Conclusion

Crafting an exceptional user experience is a moving target. Tools change. Interfaces change. People change. But therein lies the joy of the craft. The pursuit of the exceptional is a lifelong endeavor.
