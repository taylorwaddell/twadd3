# In Pursuit of Exceptional UX

<em class="text-muted">October 1, 2024</em>

User Experience is a foundational concept in any industry where there is a product involved. No matter the medium, if a product exists, and there are users of that product, there is an experience that is important to consider. If there is a groundbreaking product that no one can figure out, or it is frustrating to use, than it is not a groundbreaking product. Therefore, learning techniques to identify and implement an exceptional user experience is essential.

## What is UX?

As with any learning journey, the terms must first be clearly defined.

It is common to find UI and UX used interchangeably. There are a multitude of articles and videos that exist to explain in detail [the differences and similarities between UI and UX](https://www.figma.com/resource-library/difference-between-ui-and-ux/) so much time will not be spent here. But the relationship between the two does need to be highlighted.

The user interface, or UI, of a product is the means in which a user interacts with the product. In other words, the aspect of the product. Whereas the user experience is the relationship the user has with the interface.

Food is a great metaphor for these concepts:

| Concept        | Culinary Equivalent    |
| -------------- | ---------------------- |
| User Interface | Presentation & Garnish |
| User Experince | Taste, Smell, Emotion  |

Continuing with this metaphor, think about how that a dish can be presented beautifully and delivered by an excellent server but in the end, taste terrible.
Alternatively, a dish could be presented so poorly that no one wants to take a bite, but in actuality, it tastes divine.

Both play an important role. The presentation, or the interface, invites someone in to an experience. But the experience itself is what keeps them coming back.

## Identifying Exceptional UX

Exceptional experiences can be mostly broken up into two theoretical categories. Apparent and Subtle. Apparent user experiences are often what set a product apart in a given category. Subtle user experiences are less obvious, often expected, experiences that typically all the products in a given category will have.

### Apparent: Apple's Introduction of the Mouse (1983)

This feature opened up an entirely new way to interact with a product. It eliminated an entire educational step for users most users and finally made computers accessible for the average consumer.

> "...what we've done is eliminated a vast body of knowledge that one has to know in order to use this computer."  
> â€” Steve Jobs in [demonstration with NBC News](https://youtu.be/VKhoCyCJGFk?t=27)

Additional Apparent examples:

- The _Share Password with Contact_ drawer on iPhones.
- Windows + K key to wirelessly connect a Windows computer to an external display.
- Dyson vacuums with laser to show where the dirt is.

### Subtle: Automatic Headlights

In a vast majority of cars manufactured today, the headlights turn on and off automatically in response to the surrounding light conditions. This, at one point, was an apparent feature. These days, this feature is expected and could even lead to frustration if this feature does not exist.

Additional Subtle examples:

- Siri asking if you are actually intending to set a reminder for later this morning when you say "remind me in the morning ..." after midnight.
- Cup holders with handle slots.
- The mouse pointer change to the hand when hovering intractable elements.
- Shipping envelopes having a perforated edge.

### The Importance of Both

Apparent user experiences are great and are often the beginning of incredible innovations. Subtle experiences combine to bring great satisfaction between the user and the product.

Having both Apparent and Subtle user experiences is what makes a product exceptional.

## The Driving Forces Behind Exceptional UX

There are (at least) three driving forces behind crafting exceptional user experiences. Anticipation, Standardization, and Familiarity.

### Anticipation

Anticipation is having an awareness of what the user will expect to happen and building in accordance to this. For instance, making all the physical buttons on a phone automatically silence the ringer on a phone.  
Situation: Ringer interrupting a moment.  
Desired Outcome: Silence ringer.  
Anticipated User Action: Click buttons.

User experiences based on the process of anticipation is often starting point for user experiences that become standard in an industry. Therefore, it is often where the most opportunity lies. Anticipation is also simultaneously the most difficult to achieve due to the necessity of user base knowledge. This becomes increasingly more difficult as the user base increases due to the lack of similarity from one user to the next.
This explains the pattern of generic and specific in products. The average user takes all of there notes in their respective operating system's notes app. Alternatively, a user that is attempting the [Zettelkasten note taking method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1NJYnZCfmY&pp=ygUMemV0dGVsa2FzdGVu) will likely reach for a more specific tool that has _anticipated_ the needs of a note taking system like that. Such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

### Standardization

Standardization is consistently using the same artifact or component to achieve a given objective. Transportation infrastructure is easily the greatest example of the power of standardization.
There are multiple properties at play within the realm of transportation standards so it is helpful to focus on just one of these properties and work out from there.

For example, colors:

| Color  | Association  |
| ------ | ------------ |
| Red    | Stop         |
| Yellow | Slow/Warning |
| Green  | Go           |
| Blue   | Information  |
| Orange | Construction |
| Brown  | Recreation   |
| White  | Regulatory   |

Because of these standards, much information can be conveyed without much thinking on that part of the user.

- Stop signs
- Leads to familiarity

### Recognition

- Affordance (cite TDOETbyDON)
- Target audience
- Own bias

## Practical Application

- Identifying good UX everywhere leads to knowledge base to pull from.
- Identify friction areas.
- Consider all feedback. Not just negative. Not just verbal.
- Implement systems to be well acquainted with your audience.
- Consider audience when making decisions.

### @Developers

- Emphasize importance.
- Highest ROI = consistency.
- Visual design. See Anthony Hobday.
- Semantic, accesible HTML.
- Use the best component.
- If using a label, make it valuable.
- Simplify the DOM.
- Keep the user informed.
- Understand and Implement Visual Design Fundamentals.
