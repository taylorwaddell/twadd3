User Experience is a foundational concept in any industry where there is a product involved. No matter the medium, if a product exists, and there are users of that product, there is a experience that is important to consider. If there is a groundbreaking product that no one can figure out, or it is frustrating to use, than it is not a groundbreaking product. Therefore, learning techniques to identify and implement an exceptional user experience is essential.

## What is UX?

As with any learning journey, the terms must first be defined clearly.

It is common to find UI and UX used interchangeably. There are a multitude of articles and videos that exist to explain in detail [the differences and similarities between UI and UX](https://www.figma.com/resource-library/difference-between-ui-and-ux/) so too much time doesn't need to be spent here (rw). But the relationship between the two does need to be highlighted.

The user interface, or UI, of a product is what is strictly seen. In other words, the visual aspect of the product. Whereas the user experience is the relationship the user has with the interface.

Food is a great metaphor for these concepts:

| Concept        | Culinary Equivalent    |
| -------------- | ---------------------- |
| User Interface | Presentation & Garnish |
| User Experince | Taste, Smell, Emotion  |

Continuing with this metaphor, think about how that a dish can be presented beautifully and delivered by an excellent server but in the end, taste terrible.
Alternatively, a dish could be presented so poorly that no one wants to take a bite, but in actuality, it tastes divine.

Both play an important role. The presentation, or the interface, invites someone in to an experience. But the experience itself is what keeps them coming back.

## Identifying Exceptional UX

Exceptional experiences can be mostly broken up into two theoretical categories. Apparent and Subtle. Apparent user experiences are often what set a product apart in a given category. Subtle user experiences are less obvious, often expected, experiences that typically all the products in a given category will have.

### Apparent: Apple's Introduction of the Mouse (1983)

This feature opened up an entirely new way to interact with a product. It eliminated an entire educational step for users most users and finally made computers accessible for the average consumer.

> "...what we've done is eliminated a vast body of knowledge that one has to know in order to use this computer."  
> â€” Steve Jobs in [demonstration with NBC News](https://youtu.be/VKhoCyCJGFk?t=27)

Additional Apparent examples:

- The _Share Password with Contact_ drawer on iPhones.
- Windows + K key to connect Windows computer to external display wirelessly.
- Dyson vacuums with laser to show where the dirt is.

### Subtle: Automatic Headlights

In a vast majority of cars manufactured today, the headlights turn on and off automatically in response to the surrounding light conditions. This, at one point, was an apparent feature. These days, this feature is expected and could even lead to frustration if this feature does not exist.

Additional Subtle examples:

- Siri asking if you are actually intending to set a reminder for later this morning when you say "remind me in the morning ..." after midnight.
- Cup holders with handle slots.
- The mouse pointer change to the hand when hovering intractable elements.
- Shipping envelopes having a perforated edge.

### The Importance of Both

Apparent user experiences are great and are often the beginning of incredible innovations. Subtle experiences combine to bring great satisfaction between the user and the product.

Having both Apparent and Subtle experiences is what make a product exceptional.

## UX Theory

### Anticipation

- Often the start of UX improvements
- Exceptional UX can only be achieved if the target audience is well known.

### Standardization

- Stop signs
- Leads to familiarity

### Familiarity

- Affordance (cite TDOETbyDON)
- Target audience
- Own bias

## Practical Application

- Identifying good UX everywhere leads to knowledge base to pull from.
- Identify friction areas.
- Consider all feedback. Not just negative. Not just verbal.
- Implement systems to be well acquainted with your audience.
- Consider audience when making decisions.

### @Developers

- Emphasize importance.
- Highest ROI = consistency.
- Semantic, accesible HTML.
- Use the best component.
- If using a label, make it valuable.
- Simplify the DOM.
- Keep the user informed.
- Understand and Implement Visual Design Fundamentals.
